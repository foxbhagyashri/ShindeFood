📧 EMAIL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED
================================

Your contact form is ready, but email sending is NOT configured yet.

QUICK SETUP (5 minutes):
-------------------------

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   (You'll need to enable 2-Step Verification first if not already enabled)

2. Generate an App Password:
   - Select "Mail" 
   - Select "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter: "Shinde Foods"
   - Click GENERATE
   - COPY the 16-character password (like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

3. Open this file: backend/.env
   
4. Replace this line:
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_16_CHAR_APP_PASSWORD
   
   With (remove spaces from the password):
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop

5. Restart your backend server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the backend
   - Run: npm run dev

6. Test the contact form!

WHY DO I NEED THIS?
-------------------
Gmail requires "App Passwords" for applications to send emails.
Your regular Gmail password won't work for security reasons.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- Error "Invalid login" → You need the App Password, not regular password
- Can't find App Passwords page → Enable 2-Step Verification first
- Still not working → Check EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed help
